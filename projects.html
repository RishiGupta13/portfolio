          ever wondered if your birth date is a palindrome or not? well, then you don't need to worry, because I have
          got you covered! i have made this app in vanillaJS which tells whether your birth date is a palindrome or not.
          and again don't worry the app checks across different date formats to find a palindrome & at all if your
          birthdate isn't a palindrome in any format then the app will tell you the nearest date from your birth date
          which is a palindrome! isn't it exciting? go give it a try! üòá
