  <h1 style="text-align:center">Mummy , I love you</h1>

  <p>This is something that I really just want to go to my mom and say it , which i have not done in years, for all the things she has done for me. A mother never thinks what she will get in return. Her happiness is her children's happiness. 
   My mother has infnite energy, she always wakes up, prepares tiffin for everybody, and then do everyday chores. Sometimes I think we throw the saying "A mother never takes a holiday " very casually without realisinf the real meaning behind it
  </p>

  <p>Now that I am in bangalore living in a PG, in understand what my mother did for me everyday. she never got mentally tired of preparing food,
    doing my laundry and then to handling my tantrums after all this. And I know the reason why: Because she never wanted anything for herself, she got her happiness 
    in seeing me eat properly,wear good clothes, be happy. 
  </p>

  <p>The face that I saw when i was leaving for bangalore from mumbai , I will never forget. she was devasted to see me go. But still she controlled herself and didn't show any emotions.
    She calls me everyday to remind me to take care of my health, eat fruits, dry fruits. Ohh that reminds me that I have to eat my dry fruits which I brought from mumbai.
    Please don't tell my Mom .
  </p>

  <h3>Moral:</h3>
  <p>Please respect your mom, she is everything for us.</p>
