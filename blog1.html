  <h1 style="text-align:center">I am a Failure</h1>

  <p>From my childhood i was never a good in studies and never used to get good marks. But as things passed in my school,due to some good teachers and being with good people
    friends , gradually I got hold on my studies and was able to secure 91.8% in my 10th standard which was a big thing back then in my society as well as 
    in my family. I got many praises from many people from my society as well as from my family. This is where the praises got in my head and my downfall began.
  </p>

    As any student who scores good in 10th standard, I also took the path of science and began preparing for IIT JEE. The overconfidence, immaturity which I carried brought me down and smacked my face into the ground very hard. 
    I always thought i will study and understand at the last moment,but again this was my overconfidence. I wasted my father's lakhs of rupees and did nothing more. I got very bad marks in both JEE and MHT-CET(Local entrance Test).
    I was luckily able to get a seat in KJ Somaiya Sion in Information Technology. Again, I never learnt from my mistakes and my bad habits brought me down .
    Luckily (Again), I got placed in Brillio a Software service company where I currently am a Trainee and they are training us in Angular and Springboot.

   As I am currentlly writing this, I have prepared all projects and hope I can get into neogcamp levelOne. I have placed my hopes of improvement into this camp 
   and I hope and can get into this camp and do good things and Fall in love with programming again.

  <h3>Moral: </h3>
  <p>We should always do our work without any attachment to our emotions,ot thinking about the fruits it will bear. The only thing in our hand is the work that we can do and give our 100% . </p>
